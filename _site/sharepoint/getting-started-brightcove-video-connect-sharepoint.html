  <h2 id="installing">Installing Brightcove Video Connect for SharePoint</h2>
  <p>Before you begin installation, review the following information about prerequisites and permissions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Before a user can add an app for SharePoint, a member of the Farm Administrators group must configure the environment to support apps for SharePoint. For more information, see <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/fp161236(v=office.15).aspx">Configure an environment for apps for SharePoint 2013</a> or <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/fp161236(v=office.16).aspx">SharePoint 2016</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/fp161236(v=office.16).aspx">SharePoint 2019</a>.</li>
    <li>A user must have the <strong>Manage Web site</strong> and <strong>Create Sub-sites</strong> permissions to add an app for SharePoint. By default, these permissions are available only to users who have the Full Control permission level or who are in the Site Owner's group.</li>
    <li>When a user adds an app for SharePoint, the app requests permissions that it needs to function (for example, access to Search, or to create a list). Users who do not have those permissions are informed that they do not have sufficient permissions and the app cannot be added. The user can contact a Site or farm administrator to see if the administrator can add the app.</li>
    <li>A user logged in to a Site as the system account cannot install an app. The system account cannot import app licenses because that could result in performance problems.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Adding the Brightcove Video Connect App to the App Catalog</h3>

            <iframe class="training-video-player" src="//players.brightcove.net/20318290001/E16-WGGOe_default/index.html?videoId=5026949771001" allowfullscreen="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" height="360" width="640"></iframe>
            --></div>
  <h4>Setting Up App Catalog</h4>
  <p>To install the Brightcove connector, the first step is to set up the App Catalog in SharePoint. Use the references below to complete this step.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/fp161234(v=office.15).aspx">Manage the App Catalog in SharePoint 2013</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/fp161234(v=office.16).aspx">Manage the App Catalog in SharePoint 2016</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/SharePoint/administration/manage-the-app-catalog">Manage the App Catalog in SharePoint 2019</a></li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Adding the Brightcove Video Connect App to the catalog</h4>
  <p>Once the App Catalog is setup, follow the steps listed below:</p>
  <ol class="bcls-tasklist">
    <li>Verify that the user account that is performing this procedure is a member of the Site Owners or Designers group for the App Catalog.</li>
    <li>On the App Catalog Site, click the <strong>Apps for SharePoint</strong> list.</li>
    <li>On the <strong>Apps for SharePoint</strong> page, click <strong>new item</strong>.</li>
    <li>In the <strong>Choose a file</strong> box, click <strong>Browse</strong>, and then locate the folder that contains the <i>BrightcoveConnectorApp</i> file.</li>
    <li>Select the App, and then click <strong>Open</strong>.</li>
    <li>Click <strong>OK</strong> to upload the App.</li>
    <li>In the Item details box, supply the Name, Title, Short Description, Icon URL, and other settings for the App. Be sure that the <strong>Enabled</strong> check box is selected so that users can see the App in their Sites. You can select the Featured check box to list the App in the <strong>Featured</strong> content view of the App Catalog.</li>
    <li>Click <strong>Save</strong>.</li>
  </ol>
  <h4>Installing the Brightcove Video Connect App in a Site</h4>
  <div><!--
            <iframe class="training-video-player" src="//players.brightcove.net/20318290001/E16-WGGOe_default/index.html?videoId=5026949771001" allowfullscreen="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" height="360" width="640"></iframe>
            --></div>
  <p>Follow the steps listed below to install the Brightcove connector in a Site:</p>
  <ol class="bcls-tasklist">
    <li>Verify that the user account that is performing this procedure is a member of the Site Owners group.</li>
    <li>The App can be added to a Site one of two ways:
      <ol class="bcls-tasklist">
        <li>On any page, from the <strong>Settings</strong> menu select <strong>Add an app</strong> option.<br />
          <img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/assets/images/sharepoint/node16612-install-app-add-an-app.png" /></li>
        <li>From <strong>Site Contents</strong> using the <strong>Add an app</strong> option.<br />
          <img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/assets/images/sharepoint/node16612-install-app-add-an-app-icon.png" /></li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Next, click "From Your Organization" and then click on the <strong>BrightcoveConnector</strong> App<br />
      <img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/assets/images/sharepoint/node16612-install-app-brightcove-connector-icon.png" /></li>
    <li>In the Grant Permission dialog box, click "Trust it".<br />
      <img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/assets/images/sharepoint/node16612-install-app-trust-it.png" /></li>
    <li>At this point, the <strong>BrightcoveConnector</strong> App for SharePoint is added and appears in Apps section of your Site Contents list. It is now available for use in the Site.</li>
  </ol>
  <br />
  <img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/assets/images/sharepoint/node16612-install-app-complete.png" />
  <h4>Provisioning the Default Lists for the Brightcove Video Connect App</h4>
  <p>Before using the Brightcove connector, some required lists need to be provisioned by following the steps below:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>When the App is first instantiated, or if the lists are not present in the local Site, then the user will be presented with up to 3 options to allow for the provisioning of lists inside the Site.<br />
      <img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/assets/images/sharepoint/node16612-install-lists-create.png" /></li>
    <br />
    <li>When clicked, each button will display a message to the effect:<br />
      <img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/assets/images/sharepoint/node16612-install-lists-message.png" /></li>
    <li>When "Create Settings List" is clicked, in addition to creating the Brightcove Settings list, a prompt to edit this list is show to ensure that the proxy URL required for the Brightcove API support is configured.<br />
      <img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/assets/images/sharepoint/node16612-install-lists-videos.png" /></li>
    <li>Clicking on this link will open the Brightcove Settings list for immediate edit of the proxy server access information. Title must be set to "Proxy". The ProxyURL is specific to the location of the proxy server you will use to access the Brightcove API. See <a href="#installingproxy">Use of Proxy Server for Brightcove API communication</a> for more details on the use of the proxy server.<br />
      <img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/assets/images/sharepoint/node16612-install-lists-settings-proxy.png" /></li>
    <li>Completing the list provisioning will create the following lists in the Site:
      <ul>
        <li>Accounts - A custom list representing the Account objects.</li>
        <li>Videos - A custom list representing the video objects.</li>
        <li>Settings - List to store the proxy server details.</li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/assets/images/sharepoint/node16612-install-lists-complete.png" /></li>
  </ul>
  <h3 id="sharepointpermissions">Setting up SharePoint Permissions</h3>
  <p>A benefit of integrating the Connector into SharePoint directly is the ability to leverage its permission model. The SharePoint Admin can control which users have access to the various functions of the Connector. The following is the default set of groups which are used by the Connector to control access to the sections of the Connector.</p>

  <h2>Installing Player Solution Package for SharePoint Online</h2>
  <p>The Brightcove Player Solution Package included in the Brightcove Video Connect package allows the user to embed Brightcove video players on SharePoint Site pages. The Brightcove Player Solution Package uses out of the box SharePoint controls which are compatible with both SharePoint Online and SharePoint Server and can thus be used with both. A Player Web Part sandbox solution for embedding video is also available in the Brightcove Video Connect package but can only be used with SharePoint Server on-premise as SharePoint Online and SharePoint Server hosted by Microsoft have security restrictions prohibiting sandbox solutions; this solution is&nbsp;described in the next section.</p>
  <p>To embed a Brightcove player in SharePoint Online, the solution package described here allows the user to choose a video or playlist player and then&nbsp;player embed code is generated for the user to copy/paste into the SharePoint Embed Code dialog box.</p>
  <p>NOTE - This section requires the BrightcovePlayer.wsp solution file.</p>

<p>Since the Connector is a client side JavaScript application, a proxy server is required to broker authenticated communication to the Brightcove API. More information can be found in the <a href="https://apis.support.brightcove.com/oauth/getting-started/overview-oauth-api-v4.html">Brightcove API document.</a></p>
<p>A .net proxy App is provided in the Brightcove Video Connect package. The proxy server should be deployed in a web accessible location such as on Microsoft Azure. For security reasons, the proxy is designed to only allow connections from websites included in the web.config file that is installed with the proxy. The brightcove:origins key in the web.config file should include the SharePoint website URL for the <strong>BrightcoveConnector</strong> App as well as the website URL for the Site on which the <strong>BrightcovePlayer</strong> component will execute. See the example below:</p>
<p><code translate="No">&lt;add key="brightcove:origins" value="https://brightcovecms-a3da847a1c9e33.sharepoint.com, https://brightcovecms.sharepoint.com" /&gt; </code></p>

  <p>To launch the application, the user can click on the <strong>BrightcoveConnector</strong> App within the Site Contents listing, or click on a menu link if so configured by the SharePoint administrator.</p>
  <p>In either case, the user will be brought to the Home Page of the Connector App. This page could be further configured by the client to include additional company specific messaging, additional links, etc. As described in the installation section, depending on the group membership of the user, they may or may not see the Account Management and Add Videos tabs.</p>
  <p>The main navigation in the left column of the Connector is always present and allows the user to navigate all of the sections they have access to (see the section above regarding <a href="#sharepointpermissions">permissions</a>). Below is a brief description of the purpose of each component of the Connector:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Home</strong> - The landing page when first entering the Connector.</li>
    <li><strong>Account Management</strong> - Provides the interface for entering the Brightcove Video Cloud account(s) information into SharePoint.</li>

    <li><strong>Manage Videos</strong> - Browse and edit existing videos as well as import videos from Video Cloud into SharePoint.</li>
    <li><strong>Manage Playlists</strong> - Create new playlists as well as browse and manage existing playlists.</li>

This is a function of the Brightcove API.</li>
    <li><strong>Related Link URL, Related Link Text</strong> - The associated hyperlink and text displayed in the player for the video.</li>
    <li><strong>Start Availability Date, End Availability Date</strong> - Define the dates of availability for the video. If defined, the video will not play outside of this date range.</li>
    <li><strong>Economics</strong> - Options are Free and Ad Supported.</li>
    <li><strong>Brightcove tags</strong> - Data tags that will be saved in the Video Cloud tag information in addition to being saved in SharePoint. These are separate and distinct from SharePoint Metadata tags which some clients will want to add to this interface, and which would only be saved in SharePoint (not transferred to Video Cloud).</li>
    <li><strong>Custom Fields</strong> - The custom fields that have been added to the Connector for the selected account are displayed. Any description text defined in Video Cloud for the custom field is displayed below the field.</li>
    <li><strong>Text Track files</strong> - Text tracks can be added to each uploaded video, either on first upload or on subsequent updates. See <a href="#addingtexttracks">Adding Text Tracks.</a></li>
    <li><strong>Image Details</strong> - The thumbnail and still images for the video will be generated in Video Cloud and returned through the API to the SharePoint connector. They will be viewable when the video is accessed via Manage Videos.</li>
    <li><strong>Video File</strong> (required) - Clicking on the "Browse " button will open the local file system explorer to select the video file for upload.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Once the user clicks on the "Save" button, a validation check is run to verify all required fields are complete and the data is in the correct format. If the validation fails, the user will be prompted to complete the required fields or correct the invalid data. For example:</p>
  <figure><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/assets/images/sharepoint/node16612-videos-error-dialog.png" /></figure>
  <p>If there are no validation errors, the upload begins. During the upload, the following status modal is displayed to provide feedback on the upload progress:</p>
  <figure><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/assets/images/sharepoint/node16612-videos-success-upload-dialog.png" /></figure>
  <p>Once the process completes, the user can "close" the status dialog and the following message is displayed in the Site:</p>
  <figure><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/assets/images/sharepoint/node16612-videos-success-upload-connector-menu.png" /></figure>
  <p>The data is transferred to Video Cloud and also saved in SharePoint under the specified account and video name. A unique ID is also generated in SharePoint for each video uploaded. This ID (called the Reference ID) is transferred with the video into Video Cloud as an additional tag on the video.</p>
  <h4>"Add Multiple Video" Landing Page</h4>
  <p>By selecting the "Add Multiple Videos" option, the user can upload more than one video at a time. When this is selected, only the fields that would be shared amongst all the videos are displayed.

  <h3>Manage Videos</h3>
  <p>The Manage Videos section of the Connector is used to browse and manage existing videos. This includes editing and updating of existing videos as needed. The search functionality is used to find videos by search name, description and tag information.</p>
  <h4>Manage Videos Landing Page</h4>
  <p>The Manage Videos Landing Page displays the list of the fields that can be used to browse or search for videos in the available accounts:</p>
  <figure><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/assets/images/sharepoint/node16612-videos-manage.png" /></figure>
  <ol class="bcls-tasklist">
    <li><strong>Select Account</strong> - This dropdown list will be populated with all accounts that the user is authorized to access; this is enabled through the Account Groups assignment. The user must select an account to view any video listings.</li>
    <li><strong>Search</strong> - Filter the video results to those containing the term. Name, tags and description information along with SharePoint metadata fields, if defined, are searched. It is only possible to search in one account at a time; cross account searching is not supported.</li>
    <li><strong>Display SharePoint only or Video Cloud only</strong> - Filter the videos to only those that are recorded in SharePoint, or those that are only resident in Video Cloud and have never had their data imported into SharePoint.</li>
    <li><strong>Sort/order filters</strong> - Used to sort and order any results by the parameters listed to help find videos more quickly.</li>
  </ol>
  <h4>Viewing a Video Listing in an Account</h4>
  <p>Once an account is selected, the list of available videos for that account is displayed:</p>
  <figure><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/assets/images/sharepoint/node16612-videos-manage-sharepoint-listing.png" /></figure>
  <ol class="bcls-tasklist">
    <li><strong>Select Account</strong> - This dropdown list will be populated with all accounts that the user is authorized to access;t his is enabled through the Account Groups assignment. The user must select an account to view any video listings.</li>
    <li><strong>Display SharePoint only or Video Cloud only</strong> - The purpose of this option is to filter the videos to only those that are recorded in SharePoint, or those that are only resident in Video Cloud and have never had their data imported into SharePoint.</li>
    <li><strong>Sort/order filters</strong> - Used to sort and order any results by the parameters listed to help find videos more quickly.</li>
    <li><strong>Paging controls</strong> - Each page will display up to 5 video listings. When more than 5 are present, the paging controls will appear.</li>
    <li><strong>Video listing</strong> - Each video listing contains the following:
      <ol type="a">
        <li>Video Name - Clicking on the name will open the video for editing of its data.</li>
        <li>Short Description</li>
        <li>List of the tags associated with the video (does not list the Reference ID even though it is saved in Video Cloud as a tag).</li>
        <li>The "Edit Video" link. This link (or clicking on the Name) is used to open the video for edit if the current user has permission.</li>
        <li>Video ID: This is the Video Cloud video ID. This ID will be listed once the video is edited (even with no changes) and saved for the first time after upload.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h4>Importing a Video Cloud Only Video into SharePoint</h4>
  <p>If there is a video that was uploaded directly into Video Cloud and not through the Connector, it is possible to "import" data for that video into SharePoint so that it can be managed in SharePoint moving forward. To do this, first find the video using the "Video Cloud only" listing option (1):</p>
  <figure><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/assets/images/sharepoint/node16612-videos-manage-videocloud-listing.png" /></figure>
  <p>Then click on either the video name or Edit Video link to open the video in edit mode as described in the following sections. Once the video is saved in the edit mode, the data will also be stored in SharePoint and the video will appear in the "SharePoint Only " section.</p>
  <p><strong>IMPORTANT - The SharePoint connector only syncs data from SharePoint to Video Cloud and not Video Cloud to SharePoint. This means once you import a video from Video Cloud to SharePoint, any changes to meta data need to be made in SharePoint and any changes to meta data made in Video Cloud will not be updated in SharePoint and will get overwritten the next time that video is edited in SharePoint.</strong></p>
  <h4>Editing Existing Videos in an Account</h4>
  <p>To edit existing videos in order to update their data fields, the user can click on either the name (1) or the Edit Video link (2) in the video listing:</p>
  <figure><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/assets/images/sharepoint/node16612-videos-manage-edit-listing.png" /></figure>
  <p>The Edit Video screen will appear, with the data for the selected video displayed for edit:</p>
  <figure><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/assets/images/sharepoint/node16612-videos-manage-edit.png" /></figure>
  <ol class="bcls-tasklist">
    <li>Note that "Edit Video" is displayed in the left main navigation where Add Videos is usually displayed. This is because it uses the same page form, just in a different mode since it is an existing video. This also lets the user easily navigate back to the Manage Videos section if needed.</li>
    <li>There are certain fields that are not available for edit/update during this process:
      <ul>
        <li>The Account the video is associated with cannot be changed as videos cannot be transferred between Video Cloud accounts.</li>
        <li>The Reference ID (the Video Cloud video ID) cannot be changed.</li>
        <li>The SharePoint ID cannot be changed.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>All other displayed fields, excluding images which are autogenerated by Video Cloud, are available for update just like the first time the video was uploaded. Once the changes are made, the user clicks the "Save" button to commit the changes. The same validation that runs on Add Videos upload is also performed here.</p>
  <h4>Deleting Videos</h4>
  <p>Deleting videos from SharePoint is performed outside of the connector. To delete a video in SharePoint, navigate to Site Contents-&gt;Videos where you can find and delete the video.</p>
  <p><strong>IMPORTANT - Deleting the video recorded in SharePoint does not delete the video in Video Cloud and leaves the video in Video Cloud with some tags that were used to link the video to SharePoint. If you want to import the video into SharePoint again in the future, the tags beginning with "bcsp-" need to be removed.</strong></p>

<section class="bcls-section">
  <h2 id="search">Searching for Videos</h2>
  <p>Under Manage Videos, the user can enter a search term to find videos in the selected account that have a name, description, or tag information that matches the search term. Once the results list is displayed, all of the sorting and order filters can be applied.</p>

  <h2 id="playlists">Adding, Importing and Deleting Playlists</h2>
  <p>The Manage Playlists section of the Connector is used to create new playlists as well as browse and manage existing playlists, including editing and updating. Unlike videos, playlist information is not stored in SharePoint, but rather retrieved from Video Cloud each time an account is browsed in this section. For this reason, there are some delays inherent in the availability of playlist data through the API which will be called out in the following sections.</p>
  <div><!--
                <iframe class="training-video-player " src="//players.brightcove.net/20318290001/E16-WGGOe_default/index.html?videoId=5078707813001 " allowfullscreen=" " webkitallowfullscreen=" " mozallowfullscreen=" " height="360 " width="640 "></iframe>

  <h2 id="embedding">Adding Video to a SharePoint Site</h2>
  <p>The SharePoint connector allows content authors to insert media into their Sites in a variety of ways. This chapter covers the options that are available.</p>
  <h3>Brightcove Player Web Part for SharePoint On-Premise</h3>
  <p>The Brightcove Player Web Part Sandbox Solution generates a web part that is placed on a Site page in the internal or external website and plays the Brightcove video. SharePoint online restricts the ability of users to add in custom Web Parts so this mechanism for inserting videos is only available for on-premise SharePoint installations.</p>
  <p>The Web Part has also been augmented with some of the same features in the management console including Account Selection and advanced search with sorting and ordering to find videos and playlists faster.</p>
  <figure><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/assets/images/sharepoint/node16612-embed-player-sharepoint-page.png" /></figure>
  <p>To view the Player Web Part options, the SharePoint page needs to be in "Edit" mode (1) which will expose the option to edit the Web Part (2). The Web Part specific options are found in the "Brightcove Configuration" section (3) of the Web Part editor.</p>
  <p>Expanding the Brightcove Configuration section reveals the updated features of the Player Web Part Sandbox Solution.</p>
  <h4>Selecting a Video to Play in the Web Part</h4>
  <figure><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/assets/images/sharepoint/node16612-embed-player-video-chooser.png" /></figure>
  <ol class="bcls-tasklist">
    <li><strong>Brightcove Configuration</strong> - This section of the Web Part editor provides access to the parameters for configuring the Web Part and selecting the videos/playlists to be played.</li>
    <li><strong>Player Width, Player Height</strong> - Set the dimensions of the player.</li>
    <li><strong>Player ID</strong> - Specify the ID of the player to be used. It is important that the player selected is from the same account as the selected video if it is a multi-account environment. There is no "chooser" for the player, so the ID from Video Cloud must be entered in manually.</li>
    <li><strong>Video ID</strong> - The Video ID field is populated using a video chooser. If the user clicks on the ellipses box to the right of the field, the Chooser window is displayed.</li>
    <li><strong>Chooser Window</strong>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Select Account</strong> - Display the accounts that the current user has permission to access.</li>
        <li><strong>Available Videos</strong> - Filter the video results to those containing the term. Name, tags and description information along with SharePoint metadata fields, if defined, are searched. It is only possible to search in one account at a time; cross account searching is not supported.</li>
        <li><strong>Sort by and Order by</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Video listing window</strong> - Clicking on a video will select it for playing. The listing is limited to displaying 30 videos, so not all videos in the account may display when first selecting an account. Using the search functionality allows for refining the list to find the desired video.</li>
        <li><strong>OK button</strong> - Commit the selection and populate the Video ID field with the appropriate ID value.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>Once the Player ID and the Video ID are set, the Web Part is configured and ready to play!</p>
  <h4>Selecting a Playlist to Play in the Web Part</h4>
  <p>The process to select a Playlist to be played is almost identical to selecting a video.</p>

        <li><strong>Playlist listing window</strong> - Clicking on a playlist will select it for playing. The listing is limited to displaying 30 playlists, so not all playlists in the account may display when first selecting an account. Using the search functionality allows for refining the list to find the desired playlist.</li>
        <li><strong>OK button</strong> - Commit the selection and populate the Playlist ID field with the appropriate ID value.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>Once the Playlist ID and the Video ID are set, the Web Part is configured and ready to play!</p>
  <h3>Brightcove Player Solution Package for SharePoint Online or SharePoint On-premise</h3>
  <p>The Brightcove Player Solution Package generates embed for a player for Brightcove video that is embedded onto a page copying/pasting the embed code into the Embed Code dialog box. This package can be used for both SharePoint Online or SharePoint On-premise.</p>
  <h4>Usage</h4>
  <em>SharePoint Buttons</em>
  <p>When editing a SharePoint Site page, the "Brightcove" action group will be displayed on the ribbon:</p>
  <img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/assets/images/sharepoint/node16612-embed-player-brightcove-action-group.png" />
  <p>Select either the Brightcove Video or Brightcove Playlist option.</p>
  <em>Selection Dialog</em>
  <p>The selection dialog will allow the user to select a Video or Playlist (depending on what option was selected in the ribbon). The dialog allows you to search Video Cloud videos and playlists and displays the results in a grid:</p>
  <figure><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/assets/images/sharepoint/node16612-embed-player-selection-dialog.png" /></figure>
  <p>Upon selection of a video or playlist, the user can optionally change the player, height and width. After clicking "Ok", the script for the brightcove player will be generated and placed in the textarea at the bottom of the dialog.</p>
  <figure><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/assets/images/sharepoint/node16612-embed-player-brightcove-snippet.png" /></figure>
  <p>This script can then be added to the SharePoint page in 2 different ways:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Directly into a publishing zone</li>
    <li>By way of a Script editor Web Part, on pages that only allow Web Parts</li>
  </ul>
  <p>NOTE - This script is automatically copied to the user’s clipboard.</p>
  <em>Adding the script to a SharePoint page</em>
  <p class="BCL-aside">Note: The procedure described below is for a publishing zone; for a page that allows only Web Parts, once a script editor Web Part is on the page, the procedure is the same.</p>
  <p>To add the script to the page, after obtaining the generated script from the selection dialog, click into a publishing zone. From the "Insert" tab, look for the "Embed Code" button.</p>
  <figure><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/assets/images/sharepoint/node16612-embed-player-embed-code.png" /></figure>
  <p>In the resulting dialog, paste in the player embed script. Click "Ok". This will insert a script editor onto the page:</p>
  <figure><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/assets/images/sharepoint/node16612-embed-player-script-editor.png" /></figure>
  <p>After the page is saved, that script editor will render as the Brightcove player:</p>
  <figure><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/assets/images/sharepoint/node16612-embed-player-rendered-player.png" /></figure>
