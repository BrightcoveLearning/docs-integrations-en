  <h1>WordPress-Brightcove Connector: Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
  <summary>This topic contains frequently asked questions about the Wordpress-Brightcove Connector.</summary>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h3>Can I run the plugin on a WordPress install that isn't publicly accessible?</h3>
    <p>Yes, it will work whether it is public or not however features requiring a call-back to your site such as status updates, uploading videos, etc will be unavailable.</p>
    <h3>&nbsp;Are there any filters for plugin/theme developers?&nbsp;</h3>
    <p>brightcove_account_actions = [edit, delete]; // What actions are available when manipulating a Brightcove source.</p>
    <h3>Will this work on multisite?</h3>
    <p>Yes it will.</p>
    <h3>Can I use more than one Brightcove account?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can add sources from many Brightcove accounts if you want.</p>
    <h3>Can I set different permissions for users?</h3>
    <p>Yes. You can find a matrix of user permissions in <a href="https://github.com/10up/brightcove-video-connect/blob/develop/includes/class-bc-permissions.php#L5">this document</a>. To change user roles, we recommend using the WordPress add_cap function: <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/add_cap">https://codex.wordpress.org/add_cap</a></p>
    <h3>How does sync work?</h3>
    <p>The plugin simply pulls information directly from the Brightcove API for display and does not sync videos locally.</p>
    <h3>How can I increase Maximum upload file size?</h3>
    <p>Maximum file size is determined by your webserver and PHP configuration. You need to set the value of upload_max_filesize and post_max_size in your php.ini. php_ini_loaded_file() can help you find where your PHP.ini is located.</p>
    <p>For nginx:<br />
      http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#client_max_body_size (client_max_body_size)<br />
      For apache:<br />
      http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/core.html#limitrequestbody (LimitRequestBody)<br />
      &nbsp;</p>
    <h3>How do I enable change tracking so I can see who updated a video and when they did it?</h3>
    <p>Create a custom field of type 'text' with an internal name of '_change_history'. Whenever a video is updated, the username and current time will be added to a list of changes recorded in this field.</p>
