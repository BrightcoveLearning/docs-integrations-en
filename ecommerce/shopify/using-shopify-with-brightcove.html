    <p>Twelve videos are displayed at a time, and you can navigate through the collection using the forward and back arrows highlighted in the image above.</p>
    <h3>Filtering the video list</h3>
    <p>To filter the video list by words that appear in the title, enter those words in the <strong>filter</strong> box:</p>

    </figure>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--tip language-editable">Note that when you use multiple filters, they are applied with an <code translate="No">AND</code> logic.

    <h2 id="viewing_analytics">Viewing analytics</h2>
    <p>Go to the Analytics tab to view Analytics for your videos:</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure">
      <img class="bcls-image" src="/assets/images/shopify/analytics-tab.webp" alt="Analytics Tab">
      <figcaption class="bcls-caption--image">Analytics Tab</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information language-editable">For more detailed information about the meaning of the various analytics metrics, see the <a href="https://studio.support.brightcove.com/analytics/reports/analytics-report-reference.html">Analytics Report Reference</a>.</aside>
    <p>There are a number of options here to allow you to filter the data in different ways.</p>
    <h3>Date range selector</h3>
    <p>The date range selector gives you a variety of standard date ranges to view analytics for, and also the ability to select your own date or date range:</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure">
      <img class="bcls-image" src="/assets/images/shopify/analytics-date-range-selector.webp" alt="Date Range Selector">
      <figcaption class="bcls-caption--image">Date Range Selector</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>You can also change the time zone for the reports by clicking the <strong>GMT</strong> link below the date range selector. The link will take you to Video Cloud Studio, where, if you are an admin for the account, you can change the time zone by <a href="https://studio.support.brightcove.com/admin/general/managing-account-settings.html#account_settings">following these instructions</a>.</p>
    <h3>Report type</h3>
    <p>There are two basic types of reports you can view:</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>Performance reports</dt>
      <dd>Performance reports provide general information about the performance of the video content such as how many times videos were viewed, what devices they were viewed on, how many seconds of the video was watched, and so forth.</dd>
      <dt>Engagement reports</dt>
      <dd>Engagement reports show you how many views there were at different points in a video - remember that these are views, not viewers, so for example, if someone kept moving the playhead back and rewatched the last few seconds of the video 10 times, that would count as 10 views at that point. The trends can still be revealing, however. A sharp decline in views early in the video, for example, suggests that it is not generally appealing, while a sharp decline later in the video might indicate a boring part or something that suggests to viewers that the video is essentially over.</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>You can switch back and forth between performance and engagement reports using the report type selector:</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure">
      <img class="bcls-image" src="/assets/images/shopify/analytics-performance-engagement-selector.webp" alt="Report Type Selector">
      <figcaption class="bcls-caption--image">Report Type Selector</figcaption>
    </figure>
  </section>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="performance_report_subtypes">Performance report types</h2>
    <p>When you are viewing performance reports, there are many kinds that you can choose from using the subtype selector to the right of the report type selector:</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure">
      <img class="bcls-image" src="/assets/images/shopify/performance-report-filter-selector.webp" alt="Performance Report Types">
      <figcaption class="bcls-caption--image">Performance Report Types</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>The different reports are useful in various ways. For example, for your business model, it may be particularly useful to know whether the viewers are predominantly on desktop computers or mobile devices, or which countries most of the views occur it. Similarly, you may want to view data by day, because it is important to you to know if viewers are looking at your campaigns more on weekdays or weekends.</p>
    <p>The performance report table below the selectors show the analytics data for indiviual items. It will show up to 10 items at time, and if there are more than 10 items, you will see buttons to navigate through them at the bottom:</p>
  </section>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="performance_report_chart">Performance Report</h2>
    <p>The chart above the performance report table shows the total values for the account for different metrics over the select date range. The selector above the chart allows you to choose different metrics to view:</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure">

      <figcaption class="bcls-caption--image">Metrics Selector</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p></p>Also notice that when you mouse over one the bars on the chart, the actual data number that it represents is displayed:</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure">

      <figcaption class="bcls-caption--image">Mouse Over Performance Chart</figcaption>
    </figure>
  </section>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="engagement_reports">Engagement reports</h2>
    <p>There are also subtypes for the Engagement report type, but they are limited to video, player, and day:</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure">
      <img class="bcls-image" src="/assets/images/shopify/engagement-report-filter-selector.webp" alt="Engagement Report Types">
      <figcaption class="bcls-caption--image">Engagement Report Types</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>The chart above the engagement report table shows average engagement for videos across the account. The only change you can make in the chart is to adjust the date range.</p>
